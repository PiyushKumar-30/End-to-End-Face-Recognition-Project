## Adding Images of Another Person
To add images of another person for recognition:

* Go to the folder named labels.
* Create a new folder and rename it with the actual name of the person whose photos you are going to upload.
* Upload 3 images of the person (in PNG format) and rename the photos to 1.png, 2.png, and 3.png respectively.
